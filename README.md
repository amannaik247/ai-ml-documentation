## Steps to get your first AI/ML job
_ML engineering isn't an entry-level role, requiring a broad skill set._

**Step 1: Become a software engineer or data scientist first:**
  - Gain foundational experience in software engineering or data science for a few years.

**Step 2: Develop ML skills and deployment at work:**
  - Seek opportunities to work on ML projects and collaborate with ML teams.
  - Learn how to deploy models to production, even if it requires self-study.
  - Skills an ML engineer might need:

**Step 3: Upskill weaker areas and specialize:**
  - Identify and improve your skill gaps (e.g., software engineering for data scientists, ML theory for software engineers).
  - Specialize in one machine learning area to enhance your job prospects.

**Step 4: Operate as an ML Engineer, even without the title:**
  - Actively perform tasks like owning model deployments and writing production code.
  - This builds confidence and provides practical experience for future roles.
